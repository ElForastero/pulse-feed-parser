      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the fourth in a series of posts featuring protips from GitHubbers for improving productivity, efficiency, and more.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>When I started working at GitHub, I was hired as the first staff accountant and had never even <i>seen</i> code prior to joining the company in 2012. I remember filling out a tax form that required me to describe what GitHub does and I wrote, ‚ÄúSocial Repositories‚Äù. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="üòÑ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>It‚Äôs thanks to the social nature of GitHub as a product (and many helpful co-workers) that I started reading other people‚Äôs code and pull requests while learning Git and GitHub basics. After two years of honing my coding skills by attempting to automate some accounting processes, all the while facepalming due to yet another merge conflict, and working on open source side projects, I was offered a position to become one of GitHub‚Äôs first Data Scientists. Now as a member of our Data Science team, I get to apply my analytical and coding skills together to help GitHub (the business) better understand our users.</p>
<p>But even working at GitHub, learning Git and GitHub was hard! As its own form of an open source contribution, I want to share my top tips for getting started using GitHub for the folks who are new to coding.</p>
<h2 id="tip-1-gui-vs-cli-why-not-both">Tip 1: GUI vs CLI‚Äîwhy not both?<a href="#tip-1-gui-vs-cli-why-not-both" class="heading-link" aria-label="Tip 1: GUI vs CLI‚Äîwhy not both?" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>When you first get started with Git/GitHub, you might get to a fork in the road (no pun intended) and will need to pick whether you use the command line interface (CLI) for <a href="https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf">git commands</a> or a GUI (Graphical User Interface) like <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>‚Äîor even the <a href="https://visualstudio.github.com/">GitHub extension for Visual Studio</a>. My advice is to try both! Try out cloning repositories, branching, and committing changes to a branch‚Äîfirst in the CLI, then using a GUI. Which do you prefer? I ended up sticking with using Git commands in the terminal because I wanted to become more proficient in bash commands anyway. I also typically clone repositories using GitHub Desktop since it‚Äôs just a click away.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/121322/80028499-0d3aaa80-849a-11ea-8249-8778e75af16e.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Try both and choose the tool that works best for you right now‚Äîit may be a combo of both. As a new coder, you‚Äôll likely want to build some muscle memory with git and bash commands in the terminal, but you may also enjoy the ease of use of a GUI for some tasks‚Äîlike cloning or comparing diffs. Also, ask your fellow coders what tool they use and why! When learning Git/GitHub, it can be easier to use the same tooling as your colleagues or classmates who can help you get unstuck when you run into an inevitable git situation.</p>
<h2 id="tip-2-set-up-your-dotfiles">Tip 2: Set up your dotfiles<a href="#tip-2-set-up-your-dotfiles" class="heading-link" aria-label="Tip 2: Set up your dotfiles" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>This is a game-changer for folks running git commands in the terminal. I didn‚Äôt learn about dotfiles until after I‚Äôd been coding and using Git/GitHub for multiple years. I‚Äôm still bummed that I didn‚Äôt know about this sooner!</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/121322/80027474-ad8fcf80-8498-11ea-8d0d-fe1546492114.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Dotfiles have many uses but one neat use is they allow you to customize your terminal prompt so you can see what git branch you are on and if you have uncommitted changes. YAY! I forked <a href="https://github.com/alysonla/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a> from a former co-worker (<a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/dotfiles">John Nunemaker</a>) but if you search GitHub for <code>dotfiles</code> you‚Äôll find loads of options.</p>
<h2 id="tip-3-make-a-github-pages-site">Tip 3: Make a GitHub Pages site<a href="#tip-3-make-a-github-pages-site" class="heading-link" aria-label="Tip 3: Make a GitHub Pages site" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>A GitHub page is a personal or project-based website that GitHub hosts for free! It always helps to have an actual project to push to GitHub so you can practice your Git and GitHub skills.</p>
<p><a href="http://alysonla.github.io/"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/121322/80027345-77eae680-8498-11ea-8993-d121ea2afd38.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Make a simple website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on your own, from a coding tutorial, or even forked from another user on GitHub, then follow the details on how to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">host it on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The screenshot pictured above is my simple personal website hosted on GitHub Pages, which I forked from another co-worker, <a href="https://github.com/cobyism">@cobyism</a>. For more GitHub Pages inspiration, check out the source code for all the websites in <a href="https://github.com/collections/github-pages-examples">this GitHub collection</a> or browse repositories tagged <a href="https://github.com/topics/github-pages">#github-pages</a>. For fellow data scientists out there, there&#8217;s also a neat project called <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages">fastpages</a>, which allows you to easily publish a GitHub Pages site directly from a Jupyter notebook using GitHub Actions.</p>
<h2 id="tip-4-review-the-github-flow">Tip 4: Review the GitHub Flow<a href="#tip-4-review-the-github-flow" class="heading-link" aria-label="Tip 4: Review the GitHub Flow" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://i0.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/121322/80027671-f47dc500-8498-11ea-88ea-df698510f875.png?resize=2086%2C794&#038;ssl=1" alt="The GitHub flow represented as a giraffe that gets iterated on as it moves through the process. Image credit goes to diy.org." width="2086" height="794" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>So you have a GitHub account, you‚Äôve installed Git and/or a Git client, you‚Äôve got a sticky note for some common Git commands on your monitor, and perhaps you‚Äôve updated your dotfiles and created a personal GitHub pages site. But how does one actually <i>use GitHub to collaborate</i>? The GitHub Flow graphic (pictured above) is from a <a href="http://www.diy.org">kid‚Äôs learning site</a>, and after seeing it for the first time, I finally understood what GitHub is good for! By sharing our code, others can benefit from it and we can make something better, together! From the previous tips, note how both my dotfiles and personal website were forked from other people!</p>
<p><a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">Review the GitHub flow</a></p>
<h2 id="tip-5-practice-merge-conflicts">Tip 5: Practice merge conflicts<a href="#tip-5-practice-merge-conflicts" class="heading-link" aria-label="Tip 5: Practice merge conflicts" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>Merge conflicts can happen when you want to merge your pull request into a master branch but there are competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge. This often happens when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt remember the number of times that I‚Äôve abandoned a project or pull request because I hit a merge conflict. They scared me, the docs on how to fix them scared me, and then I was in VIM and wanted to <a href="https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/practicaldev-1-457x600.jpg">quit forever</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/121322/80027458-a963b200-8498-11ea-9cdf-3155ee536b11.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Then I realized I needed to face my fear, so I started a practice repository, created a merge conflict on purpose, and <a href="https://github.com/blog/2293-resolve-simple-merge-conflicts-on-github">walked through the documentation</a>, and watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfT0WrChMrM">a video on how to fix merge conflicts</a>. I did that a few times. And now you can <a href="https://github.com/blog/2293-resolve-simple-merge-conflicts-on-github">fix simple merge conflicts</a> in the GitHub User Interface, so that‚Äôs been handy.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/121322/80027568-d0ba7f00-8498-11ea-9baa-1e9fbae30ca3.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Today, when I hit a merge conflict, I‚Äôm slightly less scared and calmly make my way deleting the carrots, knowing that thanks to version control, I can‚Äôt mess things up too much. Or worse case, you can just <a href="https://xkcd.com/1597/">delete the project and re-clone</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tip-6-your-first-open-source-contribution-can-be-docs-and-thats-ok">Tip 6: Your first open source contribution can be Docs and that‚Äôs OK!<a href="#tip-6-your-first-open-source-contribution-can-be-docs-and-thats-ok" class="heading-link" aria-label="Tip 6: Your first open source contribution can be Docs and that‚Äôs OK!" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>If you‚Äôve made it this far, the next step is to connect with the open source community. <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/following-people">Follow</a> some people, <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/saving-repositories-with-stars">star</a> or watch some repositories, and when you‚Äôre up for it, make a contribution back to open source software by opening a pull request to request incorporating your changes back to the project. My <a href="https://github.com/railsgirls/railsgirls.github.io/pull/66">first open source contribution</a> (many, many moons ago) was a guide on <a href="http://guides.railsgirls.com/github">how to use GitHub</a> for RailGirls. Your first OS contribution can be docs and that‚Äôs OK! In fact, each year the GitHub Data Science team publishes the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">State of Octoverse</a> report that details the most popular and trending repositories and, for the past several years, some of the most widely contributed-to projects have been docs-related‚Äîfor example, <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs">Azure Docs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-devops-docs">Azure DevOps</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://octoverse.github.com/"><img class="alignnone" src="https://i0.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/121322/80028251-b03ef480-8499-11ea-8a74-9fd04f943850.png?resize=3152%2C1348&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="3152" height="1348" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h2 id="and-finally">And finally&#8230;<a href="#and-finally" class="heading-link" aria-label="And finally&#8230;" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>I‚Äôm sneaking in one last, maybe obvious tip which is&#8230;take a Git and GitHub class or tutorial! Here are a few that are worth checking out:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron">Git-it</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://youtu.be/vR-y_2zWrIE">freeCodeCamp Git/GitHub videos</a></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://guides.github.com/">GitHub Guides</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this list of tips was helpful and if these or any other tips have been useful to you on your journey to learn Git and GitHub, we‚Äôd love to hear about it!</p>

<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.blog/2020-04-22-improving-notifications-for-everyone/">Improving notifications for everyone</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.blog">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>
]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We recently made the new web notifications experience the <a href="https://github.blog/2020-02-25-your-new-web-notifications-experience-is-here/">default for everyone on GitHub.com</a>. Now, we‚Äôre removing the classic interface to focus on improving the new experience for everyone.</p>
<h2 id="a-better-notifications-experience">A better notifications experience<a href="#a-better-notifications-experience" class="heading-link" aria-label="A better notifications experience" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>Notifications was designed to keep you productive and responsive on GitHub, no matter how many repositories, organizations or teams you contribute to. With custom filters, you can create workflows that work for <i>you</i>. Maybe you start your day with requested reviews, or check in with your favorite open source repository‚Äîyou‚Äôre free to choose. Just getting started with notifications? Check out <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/customizing-a-workflow-for-triaging-your-notifications">a few techniques</a> you can use to get going.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/158833/79959349-eff6e380-847b-11ea-97d1-9e4c0439d3af.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Our new interface also works with GitHub Mobile‚Äîyour notifications, filters, and saved notifications are exactly where you expect them to be, regardless of how you use GitHub.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/158833/79965469-f6895900-8483-11ea-95e8-2c8401642733.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving forward<a href="#moving-forward" class="heading-link" aria-label="Moving forward" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>We know shifting from the previous experience is a big change, and we made sure to spend the time listening to and working with your feedback during our beta. In that time, we saw that, compared to the previous experience, you are <b>two and a half times as likely to read a notification, and you‚Äôll do so 15 hours earlier when you‚Äôre mentioned</b>. More importantly, we built this interface <i>with</i> you. We read thousands of feedback responses, hundreds of comments from maintainers, spent hours talking to you, and nearly a year developing Notifications with your help. And we‚Äôd like to thank you by doing more of the same. We‚Äôre working on giving you more filters as well as greater control of when, where, and how you‚Äôre notified of activity on GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="let-us-know">Let us know<a href="#let-us-know" class="heading-link" aria-label="Let us know" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>We‚Äôre dedicated to making notifications as simple and valuable as they can be, so you can be as productive as possible on GitHub.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GitHub Actions puts powerful CI/CD and automation directly into the developer workflow, and it became generally available just six months ago. Since then, we‚Äôve continued to improve with <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2019-11-04-github-actions-adds-dependency-caching/">artifact and dependency caching</a> for faster workflows, <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2019-11-05-github-actions-self-hosted-runners/">self-hosted runners</a> for greater flexibility, and the <a href="https://github.blog/2020-02-06-manage-secrets-and-more-with-the-github-actions-api/">Actions API</a> for extensibility. The community response has been amazing and we‚Äôre excited to share some new and upcoming enhancements.</p>
<h2 id="community-powered-ci-cd-and-workflows">Community-powered CI/CD and workflows<a href="#community-powered-ci-cd-and-workflows" class="heading-link" aria-label="Community-powered CI/CD and workflows" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>At its core, GitHub Actions allows you to automate any development workflow. Just like how our projects build on each other&#8217;s work through open source packages, GitHub Actions does the same thing for workflow automation. You can quickly reuse existing workflows or build on the thousands of free actions in the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">GitHub Marketplace</a>. There‚Äôs an action for almost everything, including: Kubernetes deployments, linting, SMS alerts, or automatically assigning and labeling an issue‚Äîand it keeps growing every day.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>GitHub Marketplace now has over 3,200 Actions, </b>representing a 500% increase in less than six months. We‚Äôre especially grateful to everyone who took place in the recent GitHub Actions Hackathon, with over 700 submissions. <a href="https://github.blog/2020-04-09-featured-actions-from-the-github-actions-hackathon/">Check out a few of our favorites</a><b>.</b></li>
<li><b>There&#8217;s a growing and extensiv</b><strong>e ecosystem</strong>, thanks to our partners. <span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs great to see how they&#8217;re expanding the ways developers can deploy their code, with new Actions from </span><a href="https://github.com/digitalocean/action-doctl"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DigitalOcean</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/tencent-cloud-cli-action"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tencent Cloud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-github-actions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HashiCorp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://github.com/docker/build-push-action"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Docker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We‚Äôre thrilled to see how GitHub Actions is helping developers, teams, enterprises, and the open source community automate their workflows‚Äîso developers can spend more time writing code.</p>

<p>The community momentum behind GitHub Actions has been tremendous, and we‚Äôve seen quick adoption with teams and enterprise customers. We want to highlight new, enterprise-focused features for GitHub Actions.</p>
<h3 id="share-self-hosted-runners-across-an-organization">Share self-hosted runners across an organization<a href="#share-self-hosted-runners-across-an-organization" class="heading-link" aria-label="Share self-hosted runners across an organization" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h3>
<p>Now, organizations can share and manage self-hosted runners across their organization using new policies and labels. This enables large teams and enterprises to centralize the management of their core infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Organization self-hosted runners</b> make it easier for multiple repositories to reuse a set of runners. This ensures runner environments are correctly configured for the organization, resources are used efficiently, and errors resulting in extra work are avoided.</li>
<li><strong>Custom runner labels</strong> are used to route workflows to particular runners. For example, compute-intensive workflows may use custom labels to ensure they‚Äôre always run on virtual machines with eight cores.</li>
</ul>

<p>Small changes can have a big impact on the daily experience for developers. Here are a few improvements that we recently shipped:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Run defaults</b> allow users to set shell and working directory defaults in their workflows, streamlining workflow files and decreasing the likelihood of errors.</li>
<li><strong>Explicit <code>include</code> matrix</strong> gives more flexibility to customer-specific legs of a parallel set of jobs, commonly used for platform-specific customization.</li>
<li><strong>Job outputs</strong> allow a workflow to easily pass data to downstream jobs, adding flexibility to how developers automate their work.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the coming months, we‚Äôll ship additional features that help our customers standardize on their workflows across organizations so they can better manage compliance and security for CI/CD and automated workflows. Some of these improvements include sharing and managing secrets across multiple repositories, the ability for organizations to create their own starter workflows for GitHub Actions, and the addition of advanced continuous deployment capabilities.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre also working closely with customers to deliver GitHub Actions and Packages to GitHub Enterprise Server.  Interested in working with us? <a href="https://enterprise.github.com/contact">We‚Äôd love to chat!</a></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Learn more about the security vulnerabilities affecting Git 2.26.1 and older.</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.blog/2020-04-20-git-credential-helper-vulnerability-announced-update/">Git credential helper vulnerability announced (Update)</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.blog">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>
]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of days ago, Git released v2.26.1 to address a <a href="https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q">critical vulnerability</a> in the credential helper mechanism. Today, the Git project is <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqq4kterq5s.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com/">releasing</a> another round of updates to address a <a href="https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-hjc9-x69f-jqj7">related issue</a> that‚Äôs present in v2.26.1 and older.</p>
<p>This vulnerability allows a malformed URL to create a credential pattern inside Git with some fields left blank. Many credential helpers interpret these blank values as an instruction to match any credential. This can result in leaking values from the underlying credential store to untrusted sources, sending the password stored for one server to another.</p>
<p>These updates address this new issue by not invoking the credential helper at all when the URL contains an un-representable value.</p>
<p>Note that not all credential helpers behave in a way that triggers the vulnerability. Git‚Äôs own <code>store</code> and <code>cache</code> helpers, along with the <code>osxkeychain</code> helper, <i>are</i> known to be vulnerable. Git Credential Manager for Windows is known to be unaffected. Other helpers should be assumed to be affected.</p>
<h2 id="upgrade-to-the-latest-git-version">Upgrade to the latest Git version<a href="#upgrade-to-the-latest-git-version" class="heading-link" aria-label="Upgrade to the latest Git version" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>The most effective way to protect against this vulnerability is to upgrade to v2.26.2. If you can&#8217;t update your client immediately, reduce your risk by following the same guidelines we <a href="https://github.blog/2020-04-14-git-credential-helper-vulnerability-announced/#upgrade-to-the-latest-git-version">recommend</a> for v2.26.1:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid running git clone with <code>--recurse-submodules</code> against untrusted repositories.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid using the credential helper by only cloning publicly available repositories</li>
</ul>
<p>GitHub has implemented additional steps on top of the ones we took to protect against the attacks discovered in v2.26.1. Specifically, that means:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Malicious <code>.gitmodules</code> (including new variants discovered in v2.26.2) are blocked from being pushed to GitHub.com.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">A new GitHub Desktop release is being prepared that prevents exploiting the new vulnerability.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The next patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server backports the push-blocking changes we‚Äôre using on GitHub.com. Note that installations themselves are not vulnerable to this new attack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Credit for finding these vulnerabilities goes to Carlo Arenas, as well as further analysis by Jonathan Nieder of Google.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, a majority of Hubbers have been working remotely, including many of our senior leaders. As a result, GitHub naturally developed a culture centered around collaboration and communication. Today we continue our series to share how Hubbers are managing remote work. Our <a href="https://github.blog/2020-04-10-remote-work-a-series-of-best-practices-for-a-remote-workplace/">first post</a> featured Kem Boggs, Head of Global Talent Acquisition at GitHub, who provided a unique perspective on how we foster a remote-friendly culture, starting with the hiring process and employee programs. </span></p>
<p>Today we introduce you to Ben Balter, Senior Product Manager at GitHub, who shares how best practices for successful communications can go a long way to establishing cultural ‚Äúrules‚Äù. Ben currently oversees the platform‚Äôs community and safety efforts. Previously, he served as GitHub‚Äôs government evangelist, leading the efforts to encourage government at all levels to adopt open source philosophies for code, data, and policy development. Ben has been working remotely for the past seven years at GitHub and has shared his wisdom on cultural guidelines for successful remote communication, regardless of your industry, role, or what tools you use.</p>
<h2 id="githubs-remote-first-communication-style-has-often-been-described-as-asynchronous-but-what-does-that-actually-mean">GitHub‚Äôs remote-first communication style has often been described as asynchronous, but what does that actually mean?<a href="#githubs-remote-first-communication-style-has-often-been-described-as-asynchronous-but-what-does-that-actually-mean" class="heading-link" aria-label="GitHub‚Äôs remote-first communication style has often been described as asynchronous, but what does that actually mean?" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>When it comes to GitHub‚Äôs asynchronous communication style, we define this by the workflows of the open source community, where many of us got our start. As a distributed and now fully remote organization, part of this is done out of necessity. Much like open source, several people are rarely in the same place and time, working on the same thing simultaneously. Like the case of Wikipedia versus Encyclopedia Britannica, distributed workflows produce better results than their traditional counterparts, and I‚Äôd argue that daily quality of life is better for those involved, as a result.</p>
<p>With this in mind, asynchronous communication through mediums like Slack or Google Docs eliminates the ‚Äúyou had to be there‚Äù aspect of most workflows. And it reduces the administrative overhead necessary to capture, collect, and share information between teams. You could have the best tools available, but without the necessary social norms, you‚Äôre ultimately setting yourself up for failure. Asynchronous communication is a preferred way to work with your remote team to avoid too many interruptions. This is especially true now with many people unexpectedly working from home‚Äîsome for the first time. Asynchronous communication provides flexibility for things like childcare, healthcare, and errands, by focusing on outputs rather than inputs.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-i-need-to-have-a-more-meaningful-discussion-to-either-brainstorm-on-something-or-solicit-feedback-from-my-team">What if I need to have a more meaningful discussion to either brainstorm on something or solicit feedback from my team?<a href="#what-if-i-need-to-have-a-more-meaningful-discussion-to-either-brainstorm-on-something-or-solicit-feedback-from-my-team" class="heading-link" aria-label="What if I need to have a more meaningful discussion to either brainstorm on something or solicit feedback from my team?" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>Simple answer: Post it where the team can discuss it. Post it before a conversation, to give people time to digest and reflect (different people consume information differently) and afterward, to memorialize and surface outcomes from the sync. There are certain discussions, such as soliciting input on a design, that might require more high fidelity mediums that aren‚Äôt easily accomplished by lower fidelity options, such as Slack or a Google Docs.</p>
<p>High fidelity, synchronous mediums, like Zoom or Teams where you can see and interact with fellow collaborators, can be extremely valuable when used correctly‚Äîthey‚Äôre often the default in some workplaces. For example, I might have some input on a post and would like to discuss it with you. Feedback is inherently human, and as such, it deserves a human face. You might choose Zoom for other situations like brainstorms and small groups or 1:1 check-ins. Last, when working remotely, it‚Äôs on you to take that extra step to be able to connect on a human level, so don‚Äôt forget to turn on your camera, especially these days when it‚Äôs really nice to see other faces.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-make-sure-im-providing-valuable-feedback-when-there-are-so-many-people-who-have-access-to-a-document">How do I make sure I‚Äôm providing valuable feedback when there are so many people who have access to a document?<a href="#how-do-i-make-sure-im-providing-valuable-feedback-when-there-are-so-many-people-who-have-access-to-a-document" class="heading-link" aria-label="How do I make sure I‚Äôm providing valuable feedback when there are so many people who have access to a document?" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>There are some things I recommend considering when thinking about providing feedback. First, avoid drive-by opinions. Assume for a moment that you have a potential say in all that your company does. What issues can you contribute to the most? Where would you have the most impact? Think twice before providing your opinion on issues fringe to your area of expertise, especially when you don‚Äôt have the full context or are unable to follow through to do what‚Äôs necessary.</p>
<p>Second, only comment if you have something to add to the discussion. It‚Äôs one thing to show that you‚Äôve taken the time to review a proposed change and give it a <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f44d.png" alt="üëç" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, but adding a standard <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f44d.png" alt="üëç" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> to a thread that already has 10+ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f44d.png" alt="üëç" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s may not be necessary. Unless what you‚Äôre posting moves the issue closer to resolution, don‚Äôt press the send button.</p>
<p>Lastly, always provide context. Courteous collaborators provide teammates with the necessary context to get up-to-speed on a discussion and decide what action they need to take (if any). Messages entitled ‚Äúa few edits‚Äù or ‚Äúminor improvements‚Äù do the exact opposite. This is especially important when including team members who are more of an FYI. In the same comment that brings them into the discussion, minimize the cognitive burden by absorbing the complexity on their behalf, and be clear about what‚Äôs being asked of them.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-best-way-to-translate-in-person-social-conventions-to-be-more-async">What is the best way to translate in-person social conventions to be more async?<a href="#what-is-the-best-way-to-translate-in-person-social-conventions-to-be-more-async" class="heading-link" aria-label="What is the best way to translate in-person social conventions to be more async?" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>My best advice here is don‚Äôt ping, just ask. There‚Äôs often the polite tendency to start a chat conversation with ‚ÄúHi‚Äù and waiting for a response before asking, or saying ‚ÄúHey, do you have sec?‚Äù While the desire to be polite is understandable, it defeats the purpose of using Slack or other tools for asynchronous communication. Just ask the question. It&#8217;s a win-win: you get your answer faster and the other person can better manage their own schedule.</p>
<p>Also, when it comes to asking questions, use private direct messages in Slack sparingly, and only when necessary. Instead, prefer shared channels whenever possible. If you mention a user by @name at the start of a message, they‚Äôll receive a notification with your question, but what‚Äôs even better is there‚Äôs a good chance someone else in the channel might know the answer and can reply immediately. Plus, it‚Äôs an open way to capture and surface organizational knowledge for others that might have the same question. That‚Äôs the beauty of a distributed, collaborative workflow.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-have-any-advice-for-how-to-capture-tone">Do you have any advice for how to capture tone?<a href="#do-you-have-any-advice-for-how-to-capture-tone" class="heading-link" aria-label="Do you have any advice for how to capture tone?" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>Many people think that it‚Äôs hard to capture tone via electronic communications, but that‚Äôs not true. Today‚Äôs tech culture is built on a foundation of emoji and animated GIFs, and we know how much Hubbers love their emojis. It‚Äôs not simply because animated GIFs of puppies are adorable, but because a <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f625.png" alt="üò•" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is often the most efficient way to express sadness or <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="üéâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> to celebrate great work. Be human and sincere. As we say at GitHub, ‚ÄúMind your words, they‚Äôre important.‚Äù</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-most-important-item-on-your-desk-right-now">What&#8217;s the most important item on your desk right now?<a href="#whats-the-most-important-item-on-your-desk-right-now" class="heading-link" aria-label="What&#8217;s the most important item on your desk right now?" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>I‚Äôve worked remotely for so many years, and I‚Äôve found that investing in a good microphone and lighting setup is really important, especially as your primary voice and face to the world. I also have a world clock with all timezones that my team is working in, which makes me more considerate of timezones.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>This is the third in a series of posts featuring protips from GitHubbers for improving productivity, efficiency, and more.</i></p>
<hr />
<p>Hello <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="üëã" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />! I‚Äôm a big proponent of the GitHub API, and building integrations to extend your workflows. I‚Äôm sharing a few features, tools, and projects to help you explore a ton of awesome potential for building on top of GitHub, and customizing it to your needs.</p>
<h2 id="github-actions-and-probot">GitHub Actions and Probot<a href="#github-actions-and-probot" class="heading-link" aria-label="GitHub Actions and Probot" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>While this is more of a topic than a tip,  you‚Äôll be hooked once you start building automation tools. GitHub Actions and Probot are separate projects with the shared goal to enable developers to extend GitHub functionality by eliminating boilerplate (like authentication and handling webhook events) and providing helpful abstractions. If you‚Äôre interested in learning more, I wrote a few <a href="https://jasonet.co">blog posts</a> about the specific features of each, but here‚Äôs a quick description of the two:</p>
<h3 id="run-your-automation-tool-with-actions">Run your automation tool with Actions<a href="#run-your-automation-tool-with-actions" class="heading-link" aria-label="Run your automation tool with Actions" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h3>
<p>GitHub Actions is a runtime for ‚Äúdoing stuff‚Äù when things happen in your repository. It‚Äôs really that vague, because you can run whatever code you want in a virtual machine, run by GitHub. A standard example is CI, but I like to focus on the more interesting bits, like tweaking and improving your workflows with the help of robots. For example, my team uses <a href="https://github.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue">JasonEtco/create-an-issue</a> to create a weekly meeting notes issue every Monday morning. There are a ton of amazing GitHub Actions out there‚Äîand tools to help you build them. If you‚Äôre interested in building Actions, check out <a href="https://github.com/JasonEtco/actions-toolkit">actions-toolkit</a>, an opinionated toolkit that I created for building Actions. I‚Äôve even used it to create a few different Actions like <a href="https://github.com/JasonEtco/is-sponsor-label-action">is-sponsor-label-action</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JasonEtco/action-record/">action-record</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/10660468/79356022-6fc8ff00-7f0c-11ea-8eab-85569d63ac51.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>You should also check out <a href="http://github.com/actions/github-script">actions/github-script</a>, an awesome action that lets you write JavaScript, with an authenticated GitHub API client, directly in your workflow YAML file.</p>
<h3 id="build-github-apps-with-probot">Build GitHub Apps with Probot<a href="#build-github-apps-with-probot" class="heading-link" aria-label="Build GitHub Apps with Probot" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h3>
<p>Next, Probot is a framework for building GitHub Apps, integrations on top of GitHub. There are a few use-cases when you might <a href="https://jasonet.co/posts/probot-app-or-github-action-v2/">choose Probot instead of Actions</a>. It focuses on webhook-driven events, so when something happens on GitHub, your Probot app can take action. Here‚Äôs a little-known fact for you: The <a href="https://slack.github.com">official GitHub/Slack integration</a> is actually a Probot app! But there are way more scoped examples, including <a href="https://github.com/behaviorbot/welcome">congratulating first-time contributors</a>, <a href="https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter">drafting release notes</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo">turning your TODO comments into issues</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/121322/79163388-d4ad1980-7d93-11ea-92d8-f72fea81fb11.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2 id="magic-url-extensions">Magic URL extensions<a href="#magic-url-extensions" class="heading-link" aria-label="Magic URL extensions" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<h3 id="get-a-user-or-organizations-avatar">Get a user or organization‚Äôs avatar<a href="#get-a-user-or-organizations-avatar" class="heading-link" aria-label="Get a user or organization‚Äôs avatar" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h3>
<p>You can get the avatar of any GitHub user or organization by visiting <code>https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;.png</code>! This is useful when you‚Äôre building websites or designs that rely on GitHub accounts, like <a href="https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors#contributors-">All Contributor‚Äôs table view</a>, or <a href="https://probot.github.io/apps/stale/">Probot‚Äôs app catalog</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/10660468/79352857-5b830300-7f08-11ea-944e-5f3e34544cf9.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Fun fact:</b> This actually returns a JPEG, not a PNG, but nothing on the Internet appears broken (yet).</p>
<h3 id="get-the-patch-or-diff-of-a-commit-or-pull-request">Get the patch or diff of a commit or pull request<a href="#get-the-patch-or-diff-of-a-commit-or-pull-request" class="heading-link" aria-label="Get the patch or diff of a commit or pull request" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h3>
<p>When I was first building <a href="https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo">todo</a>, I needed a way to get a particular commit or pull request‚Äôs diff. As it turns out, that‚Äôs super easy to do‚Äîin your browser, you can even add a couple of characters to the end of a URL:</p>

<p>And you can do the same with pull requests‚Äîcheck out <a href="https://github.com/integrations/snappydoo/pull/8.diff">this example</a>.</p>

<p>Last year, we added support for pinning Gists to your user profile. And since Gists have an API, we can use that feature in really interesting ways to pin ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù content to your profile. Using GitHub Actions, we can update a Gist on a schedule. Here are several examples:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/JasonEtco/activity-box">activity-box</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/matchai/bird-box">bird-box</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/matchai/waka-box">waka-box</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="build-your-own-pinned-gists">Build your own pinned Gists<a href="#build-your-own-pinned-gists" class="heading-link" aria-label="Build your own pinned Gists" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h3>
<p>I built a helper library called <a href="https://github.com/JasonEtco/gist-box">gist-box</a>, and if you want to build your own, check out <a href="https://github.com/matchai/awesome-pinned-gists">awesome-pinned-gists</a> for more.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Fun fact:</b> The GitHub Education team launched the <a href="https://github.blog/2019-06-03-pin-gists-to-win-a-github-education-backpack/">Pins to Win competition</a> last year, encouraging students to promote themselves and their projects on their profiles through pinned gists. There were <a href="https://github.blog/2019-06-03-pin-gists-to-win-a-github-education-backpack/">tons of great entries</a>.</p>
<h2 id="delete-branches-when-theyre-merged-to-master">Delete branches when they‚Äôre merged to master<a href="#delete-branches-when-theyre-merged-to-master" class="heading-link" aria-label="Delete branches when they‚Äôre merged to master" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>This isn‚Äôt a tip so much as a really great feature, but since it‚Äôs fairly new I want to highlight it. In your repository settings, you can enable <b>Automatically delete head branches</b>, which deletes the head branch of pull requests that are merged. Unless you rely on long-lived branches that also get merged in pull requests, this is a quick improvement. You can always restore the branch if you want, so there‚Äôs no risk. Personally, I always delete my branches right away, so why not automate it.</p>
<h2 id="get-anything-through-the-graphql-api">Get ‚Äúanything‚Äù through the GraphQL API<a href="#get-anything-through-the-graphql-api" class="heading-link" aria-label="Get ‚Äúanything‚Äù through the GraphQL API" data-anchorjs-icon="#" style="padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>
<p>This is a bit of a niche trick, but it can be extremely helpful when you‚Äôre building integrations on top of the GitHub API. If you have a URL to a resource (like a repository or an issue) then you can write one GraphQL query to return a bunch of information about it:</p>
<pre><code class="shell">query ($url: String!) {
  resource (url: $url) {
    __typename

    ... on Repository {
      nameWithOwner
    }

    ... on Issue {
      title
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>url</code> is for a repository, it returns an object with the <code>nameWithOwner</code> property. If it‚Äôs an issue, it returns the title. This can be useful when you only have a URL. Note that this doesn‚Äôt work with every single URL on GitHub‚Äîcheck out the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v4/interface/uniformresourcelocatable/">docs for <code>resource</code></a>!</p>
<p>If you aren‚Äôt familiar with GraphQL, get started with the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v4/">GitHub API docs</a>. You can also play around with GitHub‚Äôs GraphQL API with the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/">GraphQL Explorer</a>.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We‚Äôre excited to announce that GitHub has completed its acquisition of <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/612764866888007680/next-phase-montage">npm</a>.</p>
<p>The public npm registry will always be available and free for the millions of developers who use it. Now that npm is officially part of GitHub, we‚Äôre beginning work on our three immediate areas of focus:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Engaging with the community</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in the registry infrastructure and platform</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Improving the core experience</li>
</ul>
<p>We‚Äôre honored to be part of the next chapter of npm and support the JavaScript community in a new way.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.blog/2020-03-16-npm-is-joining-github/">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/612764866888007680/next-phase-montage">npm</a> blog posts for more information on what this means for the community.</p>
